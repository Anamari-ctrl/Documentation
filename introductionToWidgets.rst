Orange Widgets
==============

Introduction
------------

Orange is equipped with a variety of modular components known as widgets, each serving a specific purpose in the data analysis workflow. These widgets enable users to construct visual data pipelines without the need for extensive coding.

Data Input Widgets
------------------

**File**
   : A widget to load datasets from various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, or Tab-delimited files.
   Example: ``File`` widget allows users to import a dataset from a CSV file.

**URL**
   : Enables fetching datasets from online sources using URLs.
   Example: ``URL`` widget is used to load a dataset directly from a web link.

Data Preprocessing Widgets
--------------------------

**Data Table**
   : Displays the loaded dataset and allows users to inspect and manipulate data.
   Example: ``Data Table`` widget shows a tabular representation of the dataset.

**Preprocess**
   : Offers a range of data preprocessing options, such as handling missing values, scaling, and normalization.
   Example: ``Preprocess`` widget allows users to normalize numerical features in the dataset.

Modeling Widgets
----------------

**Classification**
   : Implements various classification algorithms for predictive modeling tasks.
   Example: ``Classification Tree`` widget enables the creation of decision tree models.

**Regression**
   : Provides regression algorithms for modeling continuous target variables.
   Example: ``Linear Regression`` widget facilitates the creation of linear regression models.

Evaluation Widgets
------------------

**Test & Score**
   : Assesses the performance of machine learning models using different evaluation metrics.
   Example: ``Test & Score`` widget evaluates the accuracy of a classifier on a given dataset.

Visualization Widgets
---------------------

**Scatter Plot**
   : Generates scatter plots to visualize relationships between two variables.
   Example: ``Scatter Plot`` widget visualizes the correlation between two numerical features.

**Distributions**
   : Displays histograms and other visualizations to explore feature distributions.
   Example: ``Distributions`` widget helps in analyzing the distribution of a specific feature.

These examples showcase a subset of Orange widgets, illustrating their diverse functionality for efficient data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Introduction
============

Hey there fellow developer!
--------
Sit tight, and with enthusiasm, join my tutorial for making your first widgets.
It provides an ideal opportunity to acquaint yourself with widget development.


This marks my first project as a new associate in the biolab, hope it will help you start developing and break the ice.

PS:
Anamari-ctrl marks an important milestone, I made it in the first year of my computer science studies ! :P
Even though it's funny, changing it now it just doesn't seem right.
